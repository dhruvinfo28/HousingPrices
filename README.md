# HousingPrices
This is my third learning project on my way to learn Machine Learning.
In this I built a model that predicts house prices from a dataset.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have two datasets, 
 train data and test data 
At initial stages train data has been used for both training and validation purposes, and then further testing with test data is done.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The model is not that accurate, but still gives some pretty good results and feel free to contribute....
